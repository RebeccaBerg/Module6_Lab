# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This program creates a templated letterhead page.

## Compiling and Running

To run this program, download the files and start a local server to host.  The
suggested way to do this is to use the Live Preview extension of Visual Studio
Code.  Once the server is running you may copy and paste the address into the 
browser of your choosing, or launch through the debugger to open in a browser.
